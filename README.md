# Basic Calculator Web App

This is a simple web-based calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations with a clean and responsive user interface.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Clear and backspace functionality
- Decimal number support
- Error handling for invalid expressions and division by zero
- Responsive button layout with hover effects

## Files

- `calculator.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the calculator interface.
- `calculator.css`: The CSS file that styles the calculator with a modern dark theme and responsive button layout.
- `calculator.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the calculator logic, handling user input, calculations, and display updates.

## Usage

1. Open the `calculator.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Use the buttons to input numbers and operations.
3. Click the `=` button to calculate the result.
4. Use the `C` button to clear the input and the `âŒ«` button to delete the last character.

## How It Works

- The calculator listens for button clicks and updates the display accordingly.
- It uses JavaScript's `Function` constructor to safely evaluate the arithmetic expression.
- Input validation prevents invalid characters and division by zero errors.
- The display is updated dynamically to reflect the current input or result.
